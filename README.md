# Personal Webpage

This project contains the files for a personal webpage for myself, Nanzheng.

## Essential Files

To host this webpage on GitHub Pages, you will need the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the webpage.
- `style.css`: The main stylesheet for the webpage.
- `IMG_0021.jpg`: The profile picture used on the webpage.
- `IMG_0255.JPG`: The background image used on the webpage.

## How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

1.  **Create a new GitHub Repository:**
    - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository. 
    - The repository name must be `your-github-username.github.io` (replace `your-github-username` with your actual GitHub username).

2.  **Upload the files:**
    - In your new repository, click on the "Add file" button and then "Upload files".
    - Upload the essential files listed above (`index.html`, `style.css`, `IMG_0021.jpg`, and `IMG_0255.JPG`).

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    - Go to the "Settings" tab of your repository.
    - In the left sidebar, click on "Pages".
    - Under "Branch", make sure `main` (or `master`) is selected and the folder is set to `/root`.
    - Click "Save".

4.  **View your webpage:**
    - Your webpage will be live at `https://your-github-username.github.io`.

That's it! Your personal webpage is now live.
